## Description 

Thank you for checking out my development porfolio! Here you can see how my projects began with some very basic skills which evolved into more complex applications and designs.

The journey to make the initial layout for this site began less than a week after I first dove into full stack development. Many times throughout I thought I would just cry; but then I would slow down, review my work, and get an "A-Ha!" moment....or "A-Ha!" adjacent. The bottom line is that these projects pushed me to accept that I can exist out of my comfort zone, on a steep learning curve, up-hill both ways, and I can do it!

## Usage 

This site serves as an overview of skills I have and continue to work on. Please click on links to see work I have completed and entertaining previews of work to come!


## Learning Points 

I had to utilize Git skills to create and maintain the repository during this project. I had to understand and assimilate HTML semantic tags and attributes. I also had to understand how to set up images, text, and flexboxes within the HTML so that I could then style them in CSS. CSS was a steep learning curve, but I was able to create flex boxes with responsive design and placement, create some pseudo-classes, as well as some basic font, text-size, and color changes.
