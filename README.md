## Description 

This application is a Password Generator. The Password Generator gives the user a series of questions including how long they would like their password and whether or not to include such characters as lower case alphabet, upper case alphabet, numbers, or symbols. Additionally, if the user chooses a password length that is too short or too long, a message appears with the available options. Also, a message alerts the user if they did not choose any character options and the process begins again.

## Usage 

This site serves as an overview of skills I have and continue to work on. Please click on links to see work I have completed and entertaining previews of work to come!


## Learning Points 

I had to utilize Git skills to create and maintain the repository during this project. I had to understand and assimilate HTML semantic tags and attributes. I also had to understand how to set up images, text, and flexboxes within the HTML so that I could then style them in CSS. CSS was a steep learning curve, but I was able to create flex boxes with responsive design and placement, create some pseudo-classes, as well as some basic font, text-size, and color changes.
